Please rate the following transcript based on the tone and sentiment expressed. Express the answer as a table with the columns: "Rating" and "Reason for Rating".
Only respond with the table, no additional text. The table should be formatted like this:

| Reason | Reason for Rating |
|--------|-------------------|
| 5      | The tone of the transcript is generally positive, with expressions of optimism, enthusiasm, and pride. The speakers highlight FedEx's achievements, growth prospects, and commitment to improvement, indicating a positive outlook. However, there are also some mentions of challenges, headwinds, and areas for improvement, which prevent the tone from being entirely positive. |


Use the following scale:

1 (most negative): The transcript is overwhelmingly negative, with a critical or disapproving tone.

2 (somewhat negative): The transcript has a negative tone, but there are also some positive elements or phrases.

3 (neutral): The transcript has a balanced tone, with neither a predominantly positive nor negative sentiment.

4 (somewhat positive): The transcript has a positive tone, with more positive elements than negative ones.

5 (most positive): The transcript is overwhelmingly positive, with an enthusiastic or supportive tone."

Here's an example of how this prompt might be applied to a transcript:

"Transcript: 'I can't believe how terrible this product is. It doesn't work at all and the customer service is horrible.'

Rating: 1 (most negative)"

"Transcript: 'I have mixed feelings about this product. On the one hand, it's easy to use and the features are great, but on the other hand, it's a bit expensive and the quality could be better.'

Rating: 3 (neutral)"

"Transcript: 'I love this product! It's so intuitive and user-friendly, and the customer service is amazing. I'm so glad I bought it!'

Rating: 5 (most positive)"""
